# What is the MeMa Physical Prototype?
The MeMa Physical Shell is a physical deployment for the Memory Machine. It consists of a **3D Printed Shell** and **Internal Hardware**. This guide can be split up into essentially 2 sections, how to print the shell and how to connect the prototype.



# 3D Printing the MeMa Shell
The **MeMA 3D-Shell** was test printed using [**PLA Plastic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing_filament) on a [**Flashforge Creator-3**](https://www.flashforge.com/product-detail/1). 

> :warning: If your 3D printer **does not support a large build plate**, you can break the model down using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). ([Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moPDPB4MY2U)) Blender is a free, open-source, general purpose, 3D Modelling Software that can be used to split down a 3D model.
